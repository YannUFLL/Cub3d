## 🌌 cub3D: 3D Ray-Casting at 42 School

Welcome to my implementation of the `cub3D` project at 42 School. An exploration of graphic design principles using Ray-Casting, inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D game.

### 🌟 Project Goals:

- **Rigor**: Adherence to the stringent requirements of C programming and the use of fundamental algorithms.
- **Graphic Design Mastery**: The project offers an opportunity to delve into graphic components such as windows, colors, events, and shape-filling.
- **Mathematics in Play**: Use mathematics to create elegant and efficient algorithms, translating theory into playful practical applications. For further understanding of Ray-Casting, visit this [reference](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html).

### 🌐 Core Features:

- **Realistic 3D Representation**: Generate a 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze using Ray-Casting.
- **Textures & Colors**: Display varied wall textures depending on their orientation (North, South, East, West). Define distinct floor and ceiling colors.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Maneuver the viewpoint through the maze using the W, A, S, and D keys. Rotate the viewpoint using the left and right arrow keys.
- **Safe Exits**: Pressing ESC or clicking the red cross closes the window and exits the program.
- **Scene Description File**: The program utilizes a `.cub` file as input for scene description, including information on textures, colors, and the map layout.

### 🚀 Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone [repo-link]`.
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd cub3D`.
3. Compile using the Makefile: `make all`.
4. Run the program with a `.cub` scene description file: `./cub3D your_scene.cub`.

### 🎖 Bonus Features Implemented:

- **Floor & Ceiling Textures**: Enhanced visuals with textured floors and ceilings.
- **Mobile Sprite Mobs**: Animated sprite characters that move within the maze.
- **Barrel Sprites**: Static barrel sprites placed within the maze.
- **Wall Textures**: Enhanced visual fidelity with multiple wall textures.
- **Wolfenstein-like Doors**: Interactive doors that can be opened and closed.
- **Minimap**: A handy minimap to help navigate the maze.
- **Mouse Movement**: Rotate the point of view using the mouse.
- **Running**: Swiftly navigate through the maze by running.
